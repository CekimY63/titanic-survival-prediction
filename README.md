# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 🎯 Project Goal
Predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using Machine Learning.
**Accuracy achieved: ~75.8%**

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering)
* **Scikit-Learn** (Random Forest Classifier)
* **Matplotlib** (Feature Importance Visualization)

## 🧠 Key Insights
1. **Data Cleaning:** Imputed missing age values using the average age.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Converted categorical data (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values.
3. **Model Finding:** The most important factor for survival was the **Ticket Price (Fare)**, followed by **Gender**.
